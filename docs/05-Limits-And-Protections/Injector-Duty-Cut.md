# Injector Duty Cycle Cut

This feature cuts the injectors in the case that a set duty cycle is exceeded temporarily or for a sustained period. Setting this up can prevent injector damage in the case that the fuel map is asking too much from the injectors.Most injectors shouldn't exceed a duty cycle of ~85-90% temporarily or ~75-85% sustained. The sustained duty cycle delay can be set at ~0.5-1 second as a safe starting point.
