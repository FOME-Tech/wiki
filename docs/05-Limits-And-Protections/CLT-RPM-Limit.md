# Coolant Based RPM limit

The CLT based RPM limit is a useful limit to put in place to prevent the car from being over-driven whilst it is cold. It can be found under __Base Engine > Limits and fallbacks__ and can be enabled by turning on the __CLT based RPM curve__. If using this feature, it is recommended to limit the engine RPM below peak engine torque until the engine has reached ~70-80 °C
