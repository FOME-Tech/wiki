# Smart and Dumb Coils 

**Dumb** coils are simply just transformers and ***require*** an external igniter to trigger them. These igniters usually make use of a **IGBT**, or more simply, an electrically controlled switch.

**Smart** coils are transformers with the igniter included, meaning there is no need for an external igniter or ignition module. The **IGBT** is built in.

***YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY IF A COIL IS SMART OR DUMB BY THE NUMBER OF PINS IT HAS***

Older vehicles will more commonly have a separate ignition module, another name for an "igniter." Strictly speaking of COP or "Coil on plug" applications, examples of this are later 2JZ-powered toyota cars, RB26-powered cars, and earlier 1.8T-powered VAG cars. BMW always has and still uses dumb coils, but instead of having a separate external module for controlling the ignition coils, the IGBTs are internal to the engine computers. Depending on the FOME-powered ECU you have, you ***may*** have IGBTs included for controlling dumb coils. Make sure to check documentation for your particular ECU.
