# Ignition coolant correction

Similar to the [CLT based RPM limit](/Limits-And-Protections/CLT-RPM-Limit), one of the aims of this table is to stop you from overworking the engine when it's cold. AS the CLT increases in temperature, the amount of timing retard can be decreased up to zero at a reasonable temperature just below operating. 

The second aim of this table is to retard the timing enough to quickly heat up the catalytic converter on a cold start which is an important feature for a vehicle to pass emissions testing.
