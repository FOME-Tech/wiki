# Ignition Coil Testing

The ignition coil testing menu can be found under __Ignition>Ignition Coil Test__. The spark numbers correspond to the ignition output numbers and cylinder numbers provided that the [firing order](/Ignition/Ignition-Settings/Firing-Order) has been configured correctly.

Like the other [bench testing settings](/Basic-Features/Bench-Test) the number of iterations, on time, and off time can be configured. The main important setting configuration here is __not to increase the on time significantly above the maximum dwell time of the ignition coils as this could cause them to overheat__. For most coils, an on time of 2-3ms should be sufficient. The off time should be in the hundreds to thousands of milliseconds so that the sparks make a distinctly audible repeating click to simplify identifying which cylinder is firing. The number of iterations can be as high as you like as the __abort test__ button can be used at any stage.
