# Individual coils   

Individual coils means that the vehicle has a separate ignition coil output for every cylinder. Under __Ignition>Ignition Settings__, the vehicle will have individual coils if there are separate outputs for every ignition pin.

Individual coils can be set up to fire sequentially or in wasted spark mode. Sequentially is generally the better option if the vehicle has individual coils as it extends the spark plug life by firing them less often (no spark is wasted).
