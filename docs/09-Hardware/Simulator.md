# Simulator

In addition to the numerous specific ECU hardware FOME targets, also made available is a build called the FOME
Simulator. The FOME Simulator is a special build of FOME designed to run on a modern computer. Naturally, many features
are missing as a general computer lacks hardware support, but the core remains. Additionally some functions are adapted
to commonly available features and sensors and outputs are mocked.

FOME Simulator not only aids development of FOME by aiding debugging, but also allows users to become familiar with the
system and tuning without spending any money and dealing with physical hardware.

FOME Simulator is provided with every release and snapshot bundle, and can be launched directly from the FOME Console or run manually (the `console/fome_simulator.exe` binary).

Currently the FOME Simulator is only built and distributed for Windows (x86_64), but it successfully builds and runs on
other platforms like Linux, and even works correctly under Wine.
