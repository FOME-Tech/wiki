# Wideband Oxygen Sensor Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to set up and configure a wideband oxygen sensor with a FOME wideband controller.

## Overview

Wideband oxygen sensors are required for accurate AFR measurement. Unlike narrowband sensors that only indicate if the mixture is rich or lean, wideband sensors provide precise AFR readings across a wide range.

## Sensor Pinout Reference

### LSU 4.9 Sensor Pinout

| Pin Number | Function | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | IP | Pump Current |
| 2 | VM | Virtual Ground |
| 3 | HEAT- | Heater Negative |
| 4 | HEAT+ | Heater Positive |
| 5 | RT | Calibration Resistor |
| 6 | UN | Nernst Voltage |

**Note:** The calibration resistor is internal to the sensor. On the sensor connector, there are only 5 wires but 6 pins, as pins 1 and 5 have a laser-trimmed resistor between them.

### F042 Controller Module Pinout

| Pin Number | Function | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Ground | Connect to chassis ground |
| 2 | LSU Ip | Connect to sensor pin 1 |
| 3 | LSU Heater - | Connect to sensor pin 3 |
| 4 | LSU Heater + | Connect to sensor pin 4 |
| 5 | No connection | |
| 6 | 12v Supply | Connect to fuel pump supply or independent relay controlled by ECU |
| 7 | No connection | |
| 8 | LSU Vm | Connect to sensor pin 2 |
| 9 | LSU Rtrim | Connect to sensor pin 5 |
| 10 | LSU Un | Connect to sensor pin 6 |
| 11 | CAN H | CAN bus high |
| 12 | CAN L | CAN bus low |

## LED Status Indicators

| Blue LED | Green LED | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| off | fast flash | Sensor warming up |
| off | slow flash | Sensor hot, operating normally |
| flashing | off | See error code table below |
| alternating | alternating | Bootloader, see below |

## Error Codes

When the green LED is off and the blue LED is flashing, this indicates an error. The blue LED will blink a certain number of times, with a 2-second pause, then repeat.

| Blinks | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 3 | Sensor failed to heat up within 30 seconds |
| 4 | Sensor overheated after entering closed loop mode |
| 5 | Sensor unexpectedly cold after entering closed loop mode (bad wiring?) |

## Bootloader LED Codes

| Blink pattern | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| alternating slowly | Firmware integrity check failed, please retry firmware upgrade |
| alternating quickly | Waiting for bootloader entry command, only occurs for ~1 second before launching firmware |

## Initial Setup

### Firmware Installation

If ordering from somewhere like JLC, wideband modules require one-time initial programming

#### DFU Method (Standalone WBO2)

For standalone units without a programmer, use the DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) method:

1. Connect USB directly to the board (5V, GND, DATA+, DATA-)
2. Pull BOOT0 to 5V during power-up to enter DFU mode
3. Make sure the transceiver isn't connected (connector PCB), otherwise USB won't work
4. Use STM32Cube software to flash the firmware (ST Link utility may not work)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Extension Cable Issues
When using extension cables, ensure all pins are connected. Some aftermarket extension cables (like certain Innovate models) may omit the calibration resistor pin (Pin 5/RT).
