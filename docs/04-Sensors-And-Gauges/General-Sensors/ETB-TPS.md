# ETB Throttle Position

Electronic Throttle Bodies typically have a **primary** and **secondary** throttle position sensor. This is to ensure safe operation of the vehicle. When connecting an ETB to a FOME ECU it is always required to have **two redundant signals** (e.g. primary 0-5v and secondary 5-0v).
