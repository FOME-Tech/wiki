# Throttle position 

Throttle position sensors are used to tell the FOME ECU the angle of the throttle blade. Most are 3 wire: 

1: Power (Provided from FOME ECU Power Output)
2: Ground (provided from FOME ECU Ground Output)
3: Signal (sent to FOME ECU Lowside input)

*ensuring power and ground come from the FOME ECU will make sure the signal is clean and consistent)

For vehicles with electric throttle bodies, throttle position sensors will need to always have two redundant signals (usually opposite ie 0-5v and 5-0v). This is to ensure safety of the operation of the vehicle.
