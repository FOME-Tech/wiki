# Throttle Position Sensor

Throttle Position Sensors are used to tell the FOME ECU the angle of the throttle blade. Most sensors are 3 wire:

1. Power (provided from FOME ECU Power Output)
2. Ground (provided from FOME ECU Ground Output)
3. Signal (sent to FOME ECU Lowside input)

Wiring power and ground from the FOME ECU will ensure a clean and consistent signal.
