# How to add, change and test a page in the wiki

## Prerequisites

- A free login in GitHub

## Simplest approach to make a small change

- go to end of page and click on "Edit this page" link
- follow GitHub's instructions for ["Editing files in another user's repository".](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository)

## Our recommended way to edit or add a larger number of pages

Get this:
[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

Clone the wiki repo
[Wiki Repo](https://github.com/FOME-Tech/wiki)

Get VScode:
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Open Wiki in VScode from github desktop

Start to edit the docs

Pages are created by right-clicking empty space in the explorer and should be named "##-xxxx.md". You fill in the "##" for a page number and "xxxx" for what the page is about. This way they will show up correctly in the wiki.

Folders are creatable with a right click, they will show up like this in the wiki

To control ordering of topics in sidebar navigation the so called "numbered prefix" concept is used.
This concept is further explained in [linked section of Docusaurus user manual](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#using-number-prefixes)

To make images work the images need to be in the same folder as the .md, image names are also case sensitive so check capitals.

This markdown cheat sheet will tell you everything you need to format pages

Save your work and proceed to testing of change.

## How to test your changes

### Prerequisites for local test

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

### Run Docusaurus locally by

Opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the cloned wiki directory:

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\wiki
```

Install NodeJS dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
*After you run this, your browser should automatically open a page to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)*

```bash
npm start
```

---

> ##### The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there

> ##### The `npm install` installs all the dependencies for your site. You'll need to run this command once when you first download the project, and again only if you `package-lock.json` file changes

> ##### The `npm start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> ##### Open `docs/13-How-to-edit-wiki.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes after hitting save

### How to publish your change to wiki

Open github desktop again, and hopefully you'll see all of the changes you've made.

It will ask you for a summary of your changes, more thorough description, and to commit the changes (see bottom left of picture)

Once you click "Commit to *master*" your changes will get automatically updated to the wiki. However, if you do not have the permissions to edit the wiki directly, you will be prompted to "create a fork." Click that, then "Fork this repository," and "To contribute to the parent project."
