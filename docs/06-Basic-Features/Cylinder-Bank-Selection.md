# Cylinder Bank Selection 

_Cylinder bank selection_ allows is an advanced setting and allows for each cylinder to be assigned a number corresponding to which cylinder fuel trim table it will use. This feature can be used to adjust the fuelling of individual cylinders in attempt to either have consistent AFRs or exhaust gas temperatures (EGT).

For cars with one WBO2 sensor or EGT probe, leave all banks at 1. For cars with multiple WBO2 sensors or EGT probes, group cylinders with the same sensor or probe in the same bank. In the cylinder fuel trims, the _Fuel trim cyl 1_ table trims all cylinders with bank 1 set, _Fuel trim cyl 2_ with bank 2 set and so on. The trim table values are in percent of fuel to add or take away E.g. if cylinder bank 2 runs 5% leaner than bank 1, add 5% trim.
