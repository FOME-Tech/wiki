# Advanced Idle Control Features

## Idle tables for cranking taper

Setting this value to __true__ enables the use of the Idle Ignition Table and Idle VE Table during the cranking to idle taper period. See _Cranking Settings > After cranking IAC taper duration (cycles)_. If set to __false__ these tables are only active when idle is detected; see Idle Detection Thresholds section of the _Idle settings_ menu.

## Coasting Idle tables

Setting this value to __true__ will enable the _Coasting IAC Position_ table. This will manually over-ride the Idle Air Control valve position during the coasting phase. This can be used to help reduce engine braking and may be useful if the engine has difficulty returning to idle.

The coasting phase is determined by first checking if the TPS (or throttle pedal position if using ETB) is less than the _TPS Threshold_. If so, FOME next checks if the current RPM is greater than the maximum idle RPM (`Idle Target RPM + RPM Upper limit`) and the engine is no longer in the _cranking IAC taper duration_. If all of these conditions are true, the engine phase is coasting and the _Coasting Idle Table_ is used.
