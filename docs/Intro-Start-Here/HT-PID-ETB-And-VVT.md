# Guide to Tuning the ETB and VVT PIDs

Let's discuss the ETB and VVT PID controls and some give techniques for tuning these loops.

$$
u(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau + K_\text{d} \frac{\mathrm{d}e(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

More details about ETB PID control are found in the Advanced Features section's page [ETB PID and Autotune](/Advanced-Features/ETB/ETB-PID.md).

More details about VVT PID control are found in the Advanced Features section's page [VVT PID Control](/Advanced-Features/Variable-Cam-Timing/VVT-PID.md).
